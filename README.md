# Project PARMOREL

Personalized and Automatic Repair MOdels using REinforcement Learning (PARMOREL).

PARMOREL is a WIP tool for automatic software models repairing using reinforcement learning (Q-Learning at the moment).

Be aware of the random nature of Reinforcement Learning algorithm, this can lead to different results in different executions.

If you want to reset the algorithm's knowledge, just delete all content inside knowledge.xml.
